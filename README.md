# UNDERTALE Template
<i> A GameMaker 2024 based UNDERTALE fangame template(engine).
<br/>
 This project is not well constructed and I'm no longer working on UNDERTALE fangame project, so it's not suggested to develop your own project upon this template.
 However, I leave some unique GML programming helpful wheels in this project, so there's probably something that would insterest or inspire you.
 If so, you're welcomed to use any code in this project. 
 <br/>
 I'd really appreciate if you could give me staff if you do use my code, and it's fine if you not tend so.
